RailzScout
==========

The RailzScout plugin implements FogBugz's BugzScout system for Rails apps.
It works by submitting your bugs to your FogBugz installation directly via 
HTTP post.

The plugin is based on the Exception Notifier plugin by Jamis Buck. Much 
works the same, but email code has been replaced with code that posts to
scoutSubmit in your FogBugz installation.


Usage
=====

1.  Include the ExceptionNotifiable mixin in whichever controller you want to
    report errors to FogBugz. (ApplicationController for the whole app.):

      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        include ExceptionNotifiable
        â€¦

2.  If you installed the plugin via default methods, you should find a 
    railz_scout.rb file in your app's config/initializers/ directory.
    (Otherwise, create the file or just edit environment.rb.)
    You should see something like this:
    
      RAILZ_SCOUT_CONFIG = {
        :url       => "http://example.com/FogBugz/scoutSubmit.php",
      # :username  => 'RailzScout',
      # :project   => 'Inbox',
      # :area      => 'Misc',
      # :force_new => false,
      }

      RailzScout.config.merge! RAILZ_SCOUT_CONFIG

   



Customizations
==============

The rendering code from Exception Notifier has barely been touched. Therefore,
the same customizations that apply to the original plugin should apply here.
